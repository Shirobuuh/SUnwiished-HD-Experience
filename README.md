# ALSO
*- ⚠️ Make sure to change the "Load/`Misc`" folder to "Load/`zMisc`", Unfortunately I made a mistake and some textures were overlapping others, I'm sorry! ⚠️*
# *This is a project with purpouse to create the best experience in Sonic Unleashed for the Wii!*

# Changes:
- *UI, Skyboxes, Maps, QTE Prompts, Buttons and Sonic*

# How to Download?
- *You can simply press Code, and Download zip, its better since you its versatile and multi-choice, you have multiple Sonics, its recommended to choose only ONE folder, then you can delete all the others. You also have to choose between PS3 and XB360 buttons, you just need to search by the UI folder and delete the one you will not need!*
- *To setup, enable custom textures option in Dolphin Emulator, then put the texture folder in `Load/Textures/RSVE8P/`, it should be fine for you to just put the folder there.*
